* Re-wrote the package to eliminate Java dependencies, which 
  causes performance issues on some systems.
* Updated GIS data to 2012: Added South Sudan, changed
  boundaries of Sudan. Note: When introducing the new ISOCODE for 
  South Sudan (728), the ISO also changed the ISOCODE for
  Sudan, from 736 to 729. We use this new code as of July 9, 2011.

* Added a distlist function that returns distances
  in a dyadic format rather than a matrix.
* Dropped United Arab Republic, which is not coded in 
  G&W. The corresponding polygons have GWCODE=-1 and 
  are dropped in all computations based on G&W.

* Fixed several unintended polygon overlaps in the
  Gleditsch & Ward coding of cshapes (for Yugoslavia 
  and its successor states). Note: in order to preserve
  the order of polygons (which were coded according to the 
  COW system) we set the G&W start date for Macedonia to the 
  COW date of April 8, 1993. (Thanks to Andreas Tollefsen)
